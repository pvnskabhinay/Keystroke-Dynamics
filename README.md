# Keystroke-Dynamics
Keystroke recognition is a behavioural biometric which utilizes the unique manner in which a person
types to verify the identity of an individual. Typing patterns are predominantly extracted from
computer keyboards, but the information can potentially be gathered from any input device
having traditional keys with tactile response (i.e., cellular phones, PDA’s, etc). Although other
measurements are conceivable, patterns used in keystroke dynamics are derived mainly from
the two events that make up a keystroke: the Key-Down and Key-Up. The Key-Down event
takes place at the initial depression of a key and the Key-Up occurs at the subsequent release
of that key.


Objective: Determine UserID for each row in “Test_Keystroke.csv” dataset based on collected
keystrokes data.
